# DPDP Requirements for the Hotel Industry

The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDP Act) introduces a new legal
framework for how organisations collect, process and store personal data in
India.  Hotels, which routinely handle sensitive guest information, are
considered **data fiduciaries** and therefore have specific obligations under
the Act.  Failure to comply can result in significant penalties, with fines of
up to ₹250 crore for inadequate security measures【629846906756457†L86-L117】.

## Why the DPDP Act Matters for Hotels

Hotels collect a wide range of personal data from guests – from names and
contact details to passport numbers, payment information and room preferences.
Under the DPDP Act, any entity that determines the purpose and means of
processing such data is a **Data Fiduciary**【879292770625649†L332-L341】.  Hotels must
therefore comply with the Act even if they operate outside India, provided they
handle the personal data of Indian residents【879292770625649†L213-L223】.

The DPDP Act empowers individuals (referred to as **Data Principals**) with
rights over their personal data, including the right to access, correct,
erase and withdraw consent【879292770625649†L236-L256】.  Hotels must respect these
rights and provide mechanisms to respond to requests.

## Key Data Principal Rights

1. **Access:** Guests can request a summary of the personal data a hotel holds
   about them and understand how it is processed【879292770625649†L236-L240】.
2. **Correction and erasure:** Guests can request corrections or deletion of
   their data when it is inaccurate or no longer required【879292770625649†L246-L249】.
3. **Withdraw consent:** Consent is not a one‑time checkbox; guests may
   withdraw consent at any time, and hotels must halt processing unless another
   legal basis applies【879292770625649†L252-L256】.
4. **Grievance redressal:** Hotels must provide a mechanism for guests to
   complain about privacy violations and, if unsatisfied, guests can appeal to
   the Data Protection Board【879292770625649†L258-L263】.
5. **Right to be informed:** Hotels must clearly explain why data is collected,
   how it will be used and how guests can exercise their rights【879292770625649†L266-L269】.

## Obligations for Hotels as Data Fiduciaries

Under the DPDP Act, hotels must:

* **Obtain explicit, informed consent:** Consent must be opt‑in and easily
  revokable【879292770625649†L350-L353】.  For minors, verifiable guardian
  consent is required【879292770625649†L374-L376】.
* **Data minimisation and accuracy:** Collect only data necessary for the
  specified purpose and keep it accurate【879292770625649†L354-L356】.  Hotels should
  maintain a data register by mapping the types of data they hold and the
  systems that process them【629846906756457†L142-L146】.
* **Security safeguards:** Implement strong information security controls such
  as encryption, access logging and continuous monitoring【879292770625649†L357-L360】.
  Hotels must also develop detailed data governance standards specifying
  encryption methods, access controls and secure storage locations【629846906756457†L165-L174】.
* **Breach notification:** Notify affected guests immediately and report the
  breach to the Data Protection Board within 72 hours【879292770625649†L361-L363】.
* **Retention and erasure:** Erase personal data once the purpose of processing
  is fulfilled, unless retention is required by law, and inform guests 48 hours
  before erasure【879292770625649†L364-L368】.  Hotels should create a retention
  schedule to identify data that can be securely disposed of【629846906756457†L149-L156】.
* **Transparency and communication:** Publish a clear privacy notice detailing
  data collection practices and provide contact details of a Data Protection
  Officer or representative【879292770625649†L369-L373】.
* **Data localisation and transfer:** Comply with government‑specified
  restrictions when transferring personal data outside India【879292770625649†L377-L380】.
* **Closing compliance gaps:** After data mapping and minimisation, conduct a
  gap assessment against DPDP requirements to build a comprehensive data
  governance framework covering the entire data lifecycle【629846906756457†L159-L165】.

## Practical Steps for Hotels

1. **Data inventory and mapping:** Identify all personal data collected across
   guest registrations, reservation systems, loyalty programs and other
   touchpoints.  Document the systems and third parties involved【629846906756457†L142-L146】.
2. **Minimise and retain data judiciously:** Remove unnecessary or outdated
   personal data by following a retention schedule【629846906756457†L149-L156】.
3. **Implement technical safeguards:** Adopt encryption at rest and in transit,
   restrict access based on least privilege and monitor systems for
   vulnerabilities【879292770625649†L357-L360】.
4. **Update consent mechanisms:** Use explicit opt‑in checkboxes and allow
   guests to withdraw consent easily【879292770625649†L350-L353】.
5. **Train staff:** Educate employees on data protection policies and how to
   handle guest data securely.
6. **Prepare breach response plans:** Establish procedures for detecting,
   reporting and responding to data breaches within the DPDP timelines【879292770625649†L361-L363】.
7. **Conduct regular audits:** Regularly assess compliance and address gaps in
   data handling, especially if designated a Significant Data Fiduciary【879292770625649†L393-L431】.

By proactively addressing these obligations, hotels can enhance guest trust,
reduce legal risks and align their operations with India’s evolving privacy
landscape.
