    <h1>Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Requirements for Hotels</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) of India establishes
      strict obligations for organisations that collect and process personal
      information. As a hotel, you act as a <strong>Data Fiduciary</strong> and
      must comply with the Act when handling guests’ personal data.</p>

    <h2>Rights of Guests</h2>
    <p>The DPDP Act grants guests several rights over their personal data. Hotels
      must put in place procedures to honour these rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Guests can ask for a summary of the personal
        data the hotel holds about them and how it’s used.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction &amp; erasure:</strong> Guests may request
        corrections to incorrect information or deletion of data that is no
        longer required.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> Consent is not permanent;
        individuals can revoke it at any time. Processing must stop unless
        another legal basis applies.</li>
      <li><strong>Grievance redressal:</strong> A mechanism must exist for
        guests to complain about data‑handling practices. If unresolved, the
        complaint can be escalated to India’s Data Protection Board.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to be informed:</strong> Before collecting data, hotels
        must explain why it’s needed, how it will be used and who to contact for
        more information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Responsibilities of Hotels</h2>
    <p>To comply with DPDP, hotels should adopt the following practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explicit consent:</strong> Use clear opt‑in checkboxes for
        collecting data and make withdrawal just as easy. Parental consent is
        required when processing children’s data.</li>
      <li><strong>Data minimisation:</strong> Collect only the information
        necessary for the stated purpose and keep it accurate. Remove
        unnecessary data according to a retention schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Security safeguards:</strong> Protect data using encryption,
        access controls and continuous monitoring. Maintain logs of who accesses
        guest data.</li>
      <li><strong>Breach notification:</strong> Notify affected guests
        immediately and report breaches to the Data Protection Board within
        72 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention &amp; erasure:</strong> Delete data once its
        purpose is fulfilled and notify guests before erasure.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Publish a privacy notice describing
        data‑handling practices and include contact details for a data
        protection officer or representative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Compliance is an ongoing process. Start by mapping the personal data you
      collect, minimise and secure it, train your staff on privacy best
      practices and regularly audit your processes. By taking these steps,
      hotels can build trust with guests and avoid costly penalties.</p>
